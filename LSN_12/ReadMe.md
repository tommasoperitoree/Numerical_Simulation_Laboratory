# How to use my code - LSN Exercise 12

For this exercise, just like for exercise 11, things are pretty simple.
Since only `python` and `Keras` from `TensorFlow` are used, the entirity of the code is contained in the Jupyter Notebooks, now divided for each subexercise: `12.1` and `12.2-3` since the two last subexercises are connected.


DELETE file `./LSN_12.ipynb`, only text of the exercise, no need to keep it.
