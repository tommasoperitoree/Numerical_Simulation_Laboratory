# How to use my code - LSN Exercise 10

All parts of the exercise have been tackled in the same directory `./10.1/`.
<br>The code is organized in the folder `./10.1/SOURCE` with the input file stored in `./10.1/INPUT` and output files stored in `./10.1/OUTPUT`.
<br>To execute the exercise, go into `./10.1/SOURCE` and follow the guidelines below

- To compile hit `make`
- To compile and run simultaneously hit `make run`
- To remove `*.o` and `*.exe` files, hit `make clean`
- More instructions on how to clean specific folder files are given in the `Makefile`
